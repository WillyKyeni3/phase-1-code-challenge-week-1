# Challenge 2: Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator ðŸ›µ

This challenge is to create a simple program to estimate the fare for a boda boda ride.

### Fare Calculation Rules:

- Base Fare: KES 50 (applied to every ride).
- Per Kilometer Charge: KES 15 for every kilometer traveled.

### Example Interaction (for a trip of 5 km):

- User is prompted: `Unafika wapi Mkubwa? Kilometer ngapi?:`
- User enters: `5`
- Console Output:
Uko kwote? Io ni 5 km:
Ukikalia Pikipiki: KES 50
Mpaka Uko: KES 75
Total: KES 125

Panda Pikipiki!
# Challenge 3: Simplified Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator ðŸ“±

This challenge is to create a simplified estimator for transaction fees.

### Simplified Fee Structure:

1. The basic transaction fee is 1.5% of the transaction amount.
2. However, there's a minimum fee of KES 10. If 1.5% of the amount is less than KES 10, the fee charged is KES 10.
3. There's also a maximum fee of KES 70. If 1.5% of the amount is more than KES 70, the fee charged is KES 70.

### Example Interactions & Outputs:

- User is prompted: Unatuma Ngapi? (KES):

- Scenario 1: User enters `500`

- (1.5% of 500 = 7.5. Fee becomes KES 10 due to minimum.)
- Console Output:
Sending KES 500:
Calculated Transaction Fee: KES 10
Total amount to be debited: KES 510
